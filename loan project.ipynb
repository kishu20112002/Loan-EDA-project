    "### Features Explanation:\n",
    "1. credit.policy: This binary feature reflects whether the borrower meets LendingClub.com's credit underwriting criteria (1) or not (0). This indicator is crucial as it signifies the outcome of the initial creditworthiness assessment based on the lender's policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. purpose: A categorical variable that represents the loan's purpose, including categories like 'credit_card', 'debt_consolidation', 'educational', 'major_purchase', 'small_business', and 'all_other'. The purpose of the loan is vital as it influences the loan's risk profile and the likelihood of repayment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. int.rate: The loan's interest rate represented as a proportion (e.g., 0.11 for 11%). Interest rates are pivotal as they reflect the lender's risk assessment—higher rates often correlate with perceived higher borrower risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. installment: The monthly installment amount the borrower must pay if the loan is funded. Installments are significant as their size can impact the borrower's repayment capacity, especially relative to their income and other debts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. log.annual.inc: The natural logarithm of the borrower's self-reported annual income. Employing the logarithm reduces income distribution skewness, facilitating better modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. dti: The debt-to-income ratio, computed as debt divided by annual income. A higher DTI suggests that a large income portion is allocated to debt servicing, potentially affecting loan repayment.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. fico: The FICO credit score, a critical measure of creditworthiness influencing loan approval and terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line, where longer histories might imply more financial reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. revol.bal: The borrower's unpaid balance at the credit cycle end, with higher balances possibly indicating financial strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. revol.util: The rate at which the borrower utilizes their revolving credit line. Higher rates can signify elevated credit risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. inq.last.6mths: The count of credit inquiries in the last six months, where more inquiries can suggest increased credit-seeking behavior and potential risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. delinq.2yrs: Instances of being 30+ days late on payments in the past two years, reflecting on the borrower's reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. pub.rec: The count of derogatory public records like bankruptcy filings or tax liens, which can significantly impact creditworthiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. not.fully.paid: The binary target variable indicating whether the loan was not fully repaid (1) or was (0). Our predictive modeling efforts focus on this outcom\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Exploration and Cleanup¶\n",
    "Loading the Data\n",
    "Load and preview the dataset to set the stage for further analysis."
